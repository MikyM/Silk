            Why Silk! ?

            Silk! is a bot that's aimed to fill gaps of other bots that simply don't quite fill, as they tend
            to compete with other bots that do the exact same thing, and usually quite poorly, at that. For most people,
            they invite one or two bots that overlap, and that's about enough for them and their server. It can kick, ban,
            and give people arbitrary levels for sending messages in chat that nobody really cares for.

            Silk! aims to bring moderation, entertainment, and utility together in a way that makes sense, and doesn't make
            it too complicated to use. Silk!, as well as the contributors that make everything possible, aim to create a bot to scale to the masses, 
            with new features that make you actually want to use the bot!
